# roman_numeral_converter
It converts roman numerals to decimal, and converts decimal to roman numerals

The main file runs a loop that let's you input decimal numbers or roman numerals
and converts the value to the other and prints it in the terminal.

You can end the program by typing 'exit'.

There are 2 other files that you can run. You can run 'convert_roman_numerals_to_decimal'. It asks for an input file upon running, as well as an output file. The input should only have roman_numerals in it of the correct syntax, and the output will the the decimal numbers listed on each line.

The 'convert_decimal_to_roman_numerals' acts exactly as the other, but instead it converts decimal numbers into roman numerals and outputs the roman numerals on each line of the output file.
